# Molecular Renderer Simulator Binaries

Hosting the pre-compiled binary dependencies for Molecular Renderer on a GitHub repo's releases page. Should be more reliable than Google Drive for downloads inside a script.

Packaged libraries:
- OpenMM, copied from the v8.3 Conda release binaries
- xTB, compiled from scratch with my `fix-gfnff-output` branch

Licenses for the respective code bases are packaged in the same ZIP as their binary download.
